## Abstract
This analysis applies quantum computing principles to analyze multiple reality phenomena in AI-generated news narratives using IBM Qiskit. The study examines quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference patterns in three text fields: news titles (新聞標題), video dialogue (影片對話), and video descriptions (影片描述).

## Methodology
- **Quantum Superposition**: Encoded narrative elements as quantum states in superposition
- **Semantic Entanglement**: Measured quantum entanglement between semantic elements
- **Narrative Complexity**: Calculated von Neumann entropy of quantum states
- **Interference Patterns**: Detected narrative conflicts through quantum interference

## Results Summary


### 新聞標題
- Average Quantum Entropy: 0.0000 ± 0.0000

- Average Coherence: 0.9386 ± 0.0733
- Narrative Superposition: 0.9670
- Semantic Entanglement: 2.0000

### 影片描述
- Average Quantum Entropy: 0.0000 ± 0.0000
- Average Coherence: 0.7907 ± 0.1674
- Narrative Superposition: 0.8106
- Semantic Entanglement: 2.0000

## Conclusions
The quantum analysis reveals patterns of narrative complexity and semantic entanglement that suggest multiple reality phenomena in AI-generated content. The quantum superposition measurements indicate varying degrees of narrative multiplicity across different content types.

## Academic Implications
This quantum approach to NLP provides a novel framework for understanding how AI-generated content can simultaneously encode multiple, potentially conflicting narratives - a phenomenon that mirrors quantum superposition in physics.
