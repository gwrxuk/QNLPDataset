# 2025-11-12 Quantum Collapse Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

Over the course of 12 November 2025 we executed an extended series of quantum-inspired natural language processing experiments that explore how different collapse strategies reshape narrative metrics for Taiwanese news datasets. Building on the fast Qiskit analyzer, we introduced configurable observation modes and measured their downstream impact on frame competition, von Neumann entropy, superposition strength, and allied indicators across 894 AI-generated text slices and 40 journalist-authored slices. Two principal configurations anchor the analysis: a post-readout collapse that samples from the terminal statevector with 4,096 measurement shots and no injected noise, and a mid-circuit collapse that simulates clause-level interpretation by performing an intermediate measurement, applying conditional rotations, and sampling with 2,048 shots combined with a 15 percent uniform noise blend. Outputs include detailed CSV tables, JSON summaries, and visual diagnostics that jointly reveal how observation timing and decoherence parameters govern the erosion of interpretive plurality.

## 2. Background and Motivation

The original fast Qiskit analyzer was designed to approximate quantum semantic dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for large corpora of Chinese-language news content. It relied exclusively on statevector simulations and reported metrics that were implicitly pre-collapse, meaning they assumed coherent superpositions persisted throughout the analysis pipeline. Conversations with collaborators highlighted the need to quantify how potential observation events—whether explicit user interactions, editorial focus shifts, or algorithmic checkpoints—might narrow the interpretive frame space. In quantum mechanical terms, these events correspond to different collapse regimes. From a media analytics perspective, they map to the ways readers commit to certain explanations at different stages of engagement. Our objective for the 2025-11-12 study was to operationalize several collapse archetypes, run them against both AI-synthesized and journalist-written corpora, and translate the numerical results into guidance for practitioners who balance storytelling flexibility with clarity and responsibility.

## 3. Datasets and Preprocessing

Two datasets support the experiments. The AI corpus (`dataseet.xlsx`) contains 298 stories, each providing fields for title (`新聞標題`), scripted panel dialogue (`影片對話`), and descriptive narrative (`影片描述`). Together they yield 894 analytical slices. The journalist corpus (`cna.csv`) contributes 20 articles drawn from the Central News Agency, preserving title (`title`, mapped to `新聞標題`) and body (`content`, mapped to `新聞內容`). Prior to quantum encoding, we standardize typography, remove empty strings, and tokenize via Jieba with a domain-specific dictionary. Stopword removal is intentionally bypassed to preserve function words that influence part-of-speech diversity. Each slice is converted into a simplified quantum circuit with at most four qubits, using segmentation-aware rotations to encode part-of-speech frequencies. This preprocessing mirrors the baseline analyzer so that any downstream differences arise from the newly introduced collapse mechanisms rather than upstream alterations.

## 4. Quantum NLP Pipeline Enhancements

### 4.1 Core Circuit Construction
The `FastQiskitAnalyzerWithCollapse` class retains the lightweight circuit generation pipeline: it creates a register with two to four qubits, applies a layer of Hadamard gates to establish uniform superposition, adds Ry rotations scaled by part-of-speech category weights, and introduces controlled-NOT entanglement between the leading qubits. The resulting circuit encapsulates the distribution of syntactic roles and co-occurrence imbalances in each text slice.

### 4.2 Collapse Abstractions
Three flags govern collapse behavior. Setting `collapse_mode="post_readout"` invokes statevector sampling at the circuit terminus. Selecting `collapse_mode="mid_circuit"` simulates an interpretive checkpoint by measuring qubit 0 mid-flow, collapsing the state, applying outcome-conditional rotations, and resuming evolution before sampling. Finally, `collapse_mode="none"` preserves the baseline behavior, providing direct pre-collapse metrics when comparison points are required.

### 4.3 Noise Parameterization
The `noise_level` argument mixes sampled probabilities with the uniform distribution to approximate decoherence or partial observational interventions. A value of 0.0 leaves the distribution untouched; 0.15, as used in the mid-circuit run, pulls each probability 15 percent toward equiprobability, ensuring that no single bitstring dominates when the sample counts are relatively small.

## 5. Experimental Configurations

We executed two baseline runs and one extended comparison. The baseline post-readout run uses 4,096 shots, `collapse_mode="post_readout"`, and `noise_level=0.0`. The second run adopts `collapse_mode="mid_circuit"`, halves the shots to 2,048 to reflect the heavier computational load of repeated state evolution, and introduces `noise_level=0.15`. Outputs are written to the `20251112_collapose` directory with filenames that encode the mode and noise configuration. Subsequent scripts rely on these naming conventions to locate and aggregate metrics.

## 6. Quantitative Results: Post-Readout Collapse

### 6.1 Aggregate Patterns
Across all AI slices, the post-readout configuration yields an average frame competition delta of approximately 0.0006559 with a standard deviation of 0.000251. Journalist slices register an average delta of 0.0005995 with a standard deviation of 0.000145. These deltas measure the decline from near-perfect competition (mean pre-collapse ≈ 0.99999999999) to slightly more concentrated distributions (mean post-collapse ≈ 0.99934 for AI and 0.99940 for journalist texts). The small magnitude confirms that pure terminal measurement exerts a gentle nudge toward dominant frames while largely preserving interpretive breadth.

### 6.2 Field-Level Nuances
- **AI Titles (`新聞標題`)**: Pre-collapse frame competition averages 0.9999999999942355 with negligible variance. Post-collapse values center on 0.999335974, producing a mean delta of 0.000664026. Von Neumann entropy dips from 3.9966 to 3.9940, while superposition strength shifts from 3.7492 to 3.7482.
- **AI Dialogues (`影片對話`)**: Frame competition declines from 0.9999999999942293 to 0.9993450198, a mean delta of 0.00065498. Entropy falls by roughly 0.00262, and multiple reality strength slides from 1.7054 to 1.7049.
- **AI Descriptions (`影片描述`)**: Metrics mirror the dialogue trend, with frame competition descending to 0.9993511628 and a delta of 0.00064884.
- **Journalist Titles**: Pre-collapse entropy exhibits wider dispersion (mean 3.85, standard deviation 0.37). Post-collapse frame competition settles near 0.999391666, generating a delta around 0.00060833.
- **Journalist Bodies (`新聞內容`)**: Competition shifts from 0.9999999999942293 to 0.9994093895, implying a delta of 0.00059061, while multiple reality strength nudges from 1.7054 to 1.7050.

### 6.3 Interpretation
The minimal deltas suggest that terminal observation primarily trims low-probability branches without overturning the relative balance among frames. Narrative complexity, as captured by entropy and multiple reality strength, remains resilient. The AI corpus, despite its higher lexical variance, responds almost identically to the journalist corpus under this gentle collapse mode.

## 7. Quantitative Results: Mid-Circuit Collapse with Noise

### 7.1 Aggregate Patterns
When collapse occurs mid-circuit with a 15 percent noise blend, the landscape changes dramatically. AI slices show an average frame competition delta of 0.0115053 (standard deviation 0.001893), while journalist slices record 0.0117438 (standard deviation 0.001990). Post-collapse competition averages near 0.9885, signaling a meaningful contraction of the interpretive distribution.

### 7.2 Field-Level Nuances
- **AI Titles**: Post-collapse frame competition drops to 0.98852345 with deltas spanning 0.00599–0.0169. Von Neumann entropy decreases from 3.9966 to 3.9508; multiple reality strength falls from 1.7001 to 1.6915.
- **AI Dialogues**: Frame competition settles at 0.98849573, with deltas averaging 0.01150. Entropy shifts from 3.99999999998 to 3.95398, reflecting the noise-adjusted sampling process.
- **AI Descriptions**: Similar declines manifest, with post-collapse competition averaging 0.98846481 and deltas near 0.01153.
- **Journalist Titles**: Post-collapse competition averages 0.987925575, with entropy dropping from 3.85 to 3.80.
- **Journalist Bodies**: Competition averages 0.988586808 with deltas around 0.01141.

### 7.3 Interpretation
Mid-circuit measurement emulates readers forming commitments halfway through a narrative. Because measurement truncates coherent superpositions earlier, subsequent evolution proceeds from a narrower state, intensifying the concentration on specific frames. Even with moderate noise, the deltas are roughly seventeen to twenty times larger than in the post-readout scenario, illustrating how timing overwhelms other parameters.

## 8. Visual Diagnostics

The histogram (`frame_competition_delta_histogram.png`) juxtaposes AI and journalist deltas for the post-readout run. Both distributions peak near 0.0006, and the long tails remain under 0.0022. Scatter plots show that nearly every slice sits below the diagonal but retains close proximity, reaffirming that post-readout collapse exerts uniform, mild pressure. Mid-circuit plots, while not yet rendered, are expected to exhibit a more pronounced downward shift and larger vertical spread, a priority for future visualization updates.

## 9. Comparative Analysis

### 9.1 Mode Contrast
Comparing the two collapse regimes reveals a simple ratio: mid-circuit deltas are approximately 17.5 times larger for AI texts and 19.6 times larger for journalist texts relative to post-readout deltas. Entropy and superposition show proportional contractions. Multiple reality strength, a composite blend of superposition, semantic interference, frame competition, and emotional intensity, decreases by 0.0005 under post-readout but by roughly 0.0087 under mid-circuit collapse.

### 9.2 Corpus Contrast
Despite stylistic differences, AI and journalist corpora react similarly within each mode. The differences that do appear—such as slightly higher emotional intensity for journalist text—do not materially alter the delta magnitude. This parity implies that collapse timing affects interpretive structure more than content origin.

### 9.3 Field Contrast
Titles exhibit the greatest sensitivity to mid-circuit collapse because they rely on compact rhetorical framing. Body content, endowed with more lexical redundancy, retains marginally higher entropy post-collapse but still converges on the same delta band.

## 10. Case Studies

To complement aggregate statistics, we reviewed representative slices from each corpus. AI-generated titles about corporate scandals displayed deltas close to the mean, indicating that even sensational headlines maintain multiple interpretive pathways until observed. Journalist features about policy debates showed similar patterns, although the mid-circuit deltas occasionally peaked near 0.016 when the narrative pivoted sharply. This suggests that abrupt rhetorical turns can magnify the effect of early observation.

## 11. Sensitivity Considerations

The present experiments leverage two discrete collapse setups. Future runs should vary both shots and noise to map the parameter surface. Lower shot counts will increase variance in sampled probabilities, potentially widening the delta distribution. Higher noise levels will counteract collapse, nudging probabilities toward uniformity and revealing the threshold where observation becomes indistinguishable from randomization. Mid-circuit measurement locations can also be diversified. Measuring after the first clause may yield drastically different dynamics compared to measuring near the conclusion.

## 12. Limitations

While the analyzer provides useful approximations, several caveats remain. The simulated circuits are capped at four qubits, limiting the granularity of representable linguistic structures. Classical fallback logic handles errors but cannot reproduce quantum-specific collapse dynamics. Additionally, the mid-circuit model focuses on a single qubit measurement, whereas real readers may consolidate multiple interpretive dimensions simultaneously. Finally, the datasets, though diverse, represent a snapshot of Taiwanese news and may not capture other linguistic or cultural contexts.

## 13. Recommendations

1. Integrate mid-circuit collapse results into dashboards and highlight the magnitude difference compared to post-readout runs.
2. Expand visualization scripts to overlay mid-circuit histograms and scatter plots for direct comparison.
3. Run parameter sweeps on noise levels to determine the tipping point where collapse becomes negligible.
4. Consider applying the analyzer to longer-form journalist pieces to test whether article length modulates collapse sensitivity.
5. Collaborate with editorial teams to interpret scenarios where early observation drastically narrows frame competition, ensuring balanced reporting strategies.

## 14. Conclusion

The updated analyzer demonstrates that observation choices significantly shape quantum-inspired narrative metrics. Post-readout collapse barely perturbs competition, while mid-circuit measurement produces order-of-magnitude contractions. These findings remind analysts that modeling reader engagement requires explicit treatment of when and how interpretive commitments form. Future work will refine these models, explore semi-classical approximations, and integrate the results into production dashboards.

5. Execute `collapse_delta_analysis.py` to derive delta summaries and histograms.
6. Review the generated markdown report alongside plots to inform presentation decks and technical documentation.

## Appendix C. Glossary

- **Frame Competition**: A scaled divergence between the observed probability distribution and the uniform distribution across measurement outcomes. Values near 1 indicate evenly matched frames; lower values indicate dominance.
- **Multiple Reality Strength**: Composite indicator combining superposition, semantic interference, frame competition, and emotional intensity to approximate interpretive flexibility.
- **Mid-Circuit Collapse**: Measurement event introduced before the circuit completes, forcing the system to evolve from a collapsed state henceforth.
- **Uniform Noise Blend**: Weighted interpolation between empirical probabilities and the uniform distribution to simulate decoherence or partial observation.
